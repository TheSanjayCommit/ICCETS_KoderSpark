              The ICCETS-2026 is a platform for both industry and academia to present and discuss innovations, trends, and concerns as well as challenges encountered and solutions in computational intelligence, emerging technologies, and sustainability. We invite researchers, professionals, and industry experts to submit their original, unpublished research contributions to these tracks that are not currently under consideration by another conference/journal, and be part of a collaborative effort to shape the future of technology and sustainability.
              <p>The regular sessions of the conference will cover a range of technical themes, including but not limited to the following:</p>
